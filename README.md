Generation of music using various neural net architectures (WIP).

This repository contains all follow-up materials, such as .ipynb labs, Kaggle competitions submission notebooks, and other stuff that gives enough foundation for the project.

Estimates for the project (WIP):

Collecting MIDI dataset - 1 week \
Autoencoder + PCA - 4 weeks \
Tuning for continuous notes and other tweaks and improvements - 2 weeks
