Generation of music using various neural net architectures (WIP).

This repository contains all follow-up materials, such as .ipynb labs, Kaggle competitions submission notebooks, and other stuff that gives enough foundation for the project.

Estimates for the project (WIP):

Basic RNN on MIDI (piano or dubstep samples) - a week
WaveNet (from the original paper) with dataset extractor - 2 weeks
Fast inference for WaveNet (separate paper) - a week
The rest of the time will almost certainly be spent on tweaking the model(s).
